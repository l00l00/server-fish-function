# Server Connection Helper

This repository contains a Fish shell function that helps manage and connect to multiple servers with different users and credentials. It provides a simple way to view available combinations for SSH connections.

## Overview

The `connect_servers` function allows you to quickly identify the SSH commands needed to connect to your servers, accommodating various user credentials and server metadata such as IP addresses and domain names.

### Features
- List available SSH connection options based on predefined users and servers.
- Outputs placeholders for SSH commands to be customized as needed.

## Prerequisites

- Fish shell installed on your system.
- Basic understanding of Fish shell syntax and commands.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_directory>
   ```

2. Create a function file in your Fish config directory:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.config/fish/functions
   touch ~/.config/fish/functions/connect_servers.fish
   ```

3. Open the function file with Neovim:

   ```bash
   nvim ~/.config/fish/functions/connect_servers.fish
   ```

4. Copy and paste the following code into the file:

   ```fish
   function connect_servers
       set -l users "ubuntu shahab root mehdi"
       set -l servers "Finland Singapore Iran"
       set -l ip_addresses "192.0.2.1 203.0.113.2 198.51.100.3"
       set -l domains "finland.example.com singapore.example.com iran.example.com"
       set -l subdomains "sub1 sub2 sub3"
       
       echo "Available combinations to connect to servers:"
       
       for user in $users
           for i in (seq (count $servers))
               set server $servers[$i]
               set ip $ip_addresses[$i]
               set domain $domains[$i]
               set subdomain $subdomains[$i]

               # Placeholder command to connect to the server
               echo "ssh $user@$ip  # Connect to $server ($domain / $subdomain)"
           end
       end
   end
   ```

5. Save and exit Neovim.

6. Load the function into your current Fish shell session:

   ```bash
   source ~/.config/fish/functions/connect_servers.fish
   ```

## Usage

To view the available SSH connection options, simply run the following command in your Fish shell:
